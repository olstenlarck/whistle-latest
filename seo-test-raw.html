Using Mac OS 9did not initially seem like such a "great idea" to me, however. I'm not one for misplaced nostalgia; I have fond memories of installing MS-DOS 6.2.2 on some old hand-me-down PC with a 20MB hard drive at the tender age of 11 or 12, but that doesn't mean I'm interested in tryingto do it again. I roll with whatever new software companies push out, even if it requires small changes to my workflow.In the long run it's just easier to do that than it is to declare you won't ever upgrade again because someone changed something in a way you didn't like. What'sthat adage--something about being flexible enough to bend when the wind blows, because being rigid means you'll just break? That's my approach to computing.

Would it surprise you to know that every one of those apps could eavesdrop on your typing? Even when it's in a secure login screen with a password field? Here is a proof-of-concept (ZIP file) that shows how an app can do this. For those of you who don't have Xcode installed, here's a video that shows what's going on: A few things to note about what you're seeing: No, this is not a WebKit bug. The Shadow DOM does a great job of protecting static user content on a web page. It's not possible to use JavaScript to view the contents of an input field on iOS since the current value attribute is actually being held in a platform-native control. The value of that control is uploaded when the user submits a </p><form>. I don't know for sure, but I suspect that the keyCode attribute of the KeyboardEvent in the JavaScript event handler is pro<p></p></form></article><article><h1 class="title">PathFinding.js</h1><p class="summary"></p></article><article><h1 class="title">How Twitter Uses Redis to Scale - 105TB RAM, 39MM QPS, 10,000+ Instances&nbsp; - High Scalability -</h1><p class="summary">Yao Yu has worked on Twitter's Cache team since 2010. She recently gave a really great talk: Scaling Redis at Twitter. It's about Redis of course, but it's not just about Redis. Yao has worked at Twitter for a few years. She's seen some things. She's watched the growth of the cache service at Twitter explode from it being used by just one project to nearly a hundred projects using it. That's many thousands of machines, many clusters, and many terabytes of RAM. It's clear from her talk that's she's coming from a place of real personal experience and that shines through in the practical way she explores issues. It's a talk well worth watching. As you might expect, Twitter has a lot of cache. You'll learn more about BTree and Hybrid List later in the post. A couple of points stood out: With that in mind, let's learn more about how Redis is used at Twitter: Redis drives Timeline, Twitter's mo</p></article><article><h1 class="title">jakubroztocil/cloudtunes</h1><p class="summary">Open source, web-based music player for the cloud.   [hn] CloudTunes provides a unified interface 
for music stored in the cloud (YouTube, Dropbox, etc.) and integrates with 
Last.fm, Facebook, 
and Musicbrainz for metadata, discovery, 
and social experience. It is similar to services like Spotify, 
except instead of local tracks and the fixed Spotify catalog, 
CloudTunes uses your files stored in Dropbox and music videos on YouTube. CloudTunes is a side project of 
@jakubroztocil who is a bit of a 
music nerd and who likes to 
build stuff.  In 2012 he decided 
to create an iTunes-like webapp to make music stored all over the cloud 
easily discoverable and accessible: hence CloudTunes. One of the goals was to experiment with a bunch of new technologies as well.
Later the side-project has been largely abandoned due to other more pressing 
projects. In the autumn of 2014 CloudTunes has been</p></article><article><h1 class="title">erming/shout · GitHub</h1><p class="summary">What is it?
