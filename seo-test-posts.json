Using Mac OS 9did not initially seem like such a \"great idea\" to me, however. I'm not one for misplaced nostalgia; I have fond memories of installing MS-DOS 6.2.2 on some old hand-me-down PC with a 20MB hard drive at the tender age of 11 or 12, but that doesn't mean I'm interested in tryingto do it again. I roll with whatever new software companies push out, even if it requires small changes to my workflow.In the long run it's just easier to do that than it is to declare you won't ever upgrade again because someone changed something in a way you didn't like. What'sthat adage--something about being flexible enough to bend when the wind blows, because being rigid means you'll just break? That's my approach to computing. Open s",

For those of you who don't have Xcode installed, here's a video that shows what's going on: A few things to note about what you're seeing: No, this is not a WebKit bug. The Shadow DOM does a great job of protecting static user content on a web page. It's not possible to use JavaScript to view the contents of an input field on iOS since the current value attribute is actually being held in a platform-native control. The value of that control is uploaded when the user submits a <form>. I don't know for sure, but I suspect that the keyCode attribute of the KeyboardEvent in the JavaScript event handler is pro",

Yao has worked at Twitter for a few years. She's seen some things. She's watched the growth of the cache service at Twitter explode from it being used by just one project to nearly a hundred projects using it. That's many thousands of machines, many clusters, and many terabytes of RAM. It's clear from her talk that's she's coming from a place of real personal experience and that shines through in the practical way she explores issues. It's a talk well worth watching. As you might expect, Twitter has a lot of cache. You'll learn more about BTree and Hybrid List later in the post. A couple of points stood out: With that in mind, let's learn more about how Redis is used at Twitter: Redis drives Timeline, Twitter's mo",
